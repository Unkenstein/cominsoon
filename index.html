    <h2>Welcome to the Plant Hotel</h2>

    <p>Do your own thing, and let others do theirs. If they're not hurting anyone, what's the problem? Chill people don't look for reasons or opportunities to hate on others just for being different. There's no reason to bully or tread on other people's territory. Try to be happy with yourself and encourage self-love in others, too and remember be yourself.</p>

    <p>Unless someone is rude to you, your day should go by smoothly by being polite, considerate, and nice. Chill people don't antagonize for the sake of it or stir up a bunch of negative emotions by being jerks; chill people are generally kind and get along well with others. However, try to avoid going overboard so you don't become a people-pleaser or pushover.</p>

    <p>Don't sweat the small stuff. Take your life in stride. Roll with the punches and be accepting of the little things life throws your way, reserving your passion for what matters to you most. This is pretty much the defining feature of a chill person.</p>

    <h2>Prepare your chill</h2>

    <p>Be fun to hang out with. Don't be someone who is really boring and afraid to try new things. Go out and do stuff you consider fun and be someone that other people want to spend time with. Talk with people, go see movies, play games, go on hikes or go camping: it's all good!</p>

    <p>Make and follow your own trends. Be unique. A chill person doesn't feel the need to follow all the trends set by others, they just do what they want and what makes them happy. This laid back attitude inspires others to be more laid back and people will want to be around you more often.</p>

    <h2>The best chills are those most chilled</h2>

    <p>Pick your battles. Some things in life are bound to upset or anger you, and while it's okay to have those feelings, it's best not to nosedive into every argument that presents itself. Stop, take a deep breath, and decide whether an unpleasant situation is worth getting into. Catch yourself before you get stuck in a pointless argument or a big scene. From here, you can redirect the situation to be in your favor.</p>

    <p>Redirect your thoughts. Distract yourself from your immediate feelings by redirecting your thoughts. There are lots of ways you can do this. You can count your breaths. You can even sing a song (inside your head is probably better than out loud).</p>

  The new facilities mean that the hotel's experienced plant spa technicians can help your plants beat the heat with hand-powered misting and deep tissue drenching. The hotel can accommodate for sun-seekers like the cactus, through to shade-lovers like the snake plant, and will ensure the leafy residents stay hydrated and loved whilst you enjoy a guilt-free, carefree break. When you return from your holiday, your plants will check-out in tip-top shape.
